I'm going to grab all of the files on my desktop and move them into a folder
in my Documents.

Some files are in C:\\Users\denni\Desktop, some are in C:\\Users\Public\Desktop

python os
python shutils

# run in background:
python3.6\pythonw.exe code\python\lawn-mower\main.py

# schedule task
python sched - schedule is simpler with all the necessary func
python time

# to stop process
taskkill /pid <processId> /f


I need to generalize the loading process, *
handle errors and overwriting, *
schedule delays. *

figure out py2exe and
background running
